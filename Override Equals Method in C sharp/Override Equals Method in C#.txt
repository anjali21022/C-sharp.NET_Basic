Override Equals Method in C
  What is Equals Method in C#?
    The Equals is a virtual method defined in the Object class and this method is available to all the .NET Types as Object is the superclass of all .NET Types.
    As Equals is a virtual method, we can also override this method under our classes. The following is the signature of this method.
    public virtual bool Equals(object obj): This method is used to determine whether the specified object is equal to the current object. 
    Here, the parameter obj specifies the object to compare with the current object. It returns true if the specified object is equal to the current object; otherwise, false.
    Before understanding how to override and when to override, let us first understand what is the difference between the == Operator and Equals method in C#.

  Difference Between the “==” Operator and the Equals() Method in C#:
    As we already discussed every type in .NET, directly or indirectly inherits from the Object class. So, the Equals() virtual method, which has a default implementation
    within the Object class is also available in every .NET (Primitive as well as Reference) type via inheritance. 

  Equals method and == Operator with Reference Type in C#:
    If the type is a reference type, then by default both the == operator and Equals method check for reference equality whereas we can change this default behavior
    of the Equals() method by overriding it to check for value equality.
