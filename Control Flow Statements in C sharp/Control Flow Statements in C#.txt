Control Flow Statements in C#
  The Control Flow Statements in C# are the statements that Alter the Flow of Program Execution and provide better control to the programmer on the flow of
  execution. The Control Flow Statements are useful to write better and more complex programs. A program executes from top to bottom except when we use 
  control statements. We can control the order of execution of the program, based on logic and values.
  Generally, the statements inside our C# program are executed from top to bottom, in the order that they appear. The Control flow statements, change or break
  the flow of execution by implementing decision-making, looping, and branching in our program to execute particular blocks of code based on the conditions.

  Types of Control Flow Statements in C#
    In C#, the control flow statements are divided into the following three categories:
    1) Selection Statements or Branching Statements: (Examples: if-else, switch case, nested if-else, if-else ladder)
    2) Iteration Statements or Looping Statements: (Examples: while loop, do-while loop, for-loop, and foreach loop)
    3) Jumping Statements: (Examples: break, continue, return, goto)
