Break Statement in C#

  What are Jump Statements in C# Language?
    The Jump Statements in C# are used to transfer control from one point or location or statement to another point or location or statement in the program 
    due to some specified condition while executing the program.
    The Jump Statements in C# Language are used to modify the behavior of conditional (if, else, switch) and iterative (for, while, and do-while) statements. 
    The Jump Statements allow us to exit a loop, and start the next iteration, or explicitly transfer the program control to a specified location in your program.
    C# supports the following jump statements:
    1) break
    2) continue
    3) goto
    4) return (In the Function section we will discuss the return statement)
    5) throw (In the Exception Handling section we will discuss the throw statement)

  Break Statement in C# Language:
    In C#, the break is a keyword. By using the break statement, we can terminate either the loop body or the switch body. The most important point that you need to 
    keep in mind is the use of a break statement is optional but if you want to use then the break statement should be placed either within the loop body or switch body.

  Syntax: break;
