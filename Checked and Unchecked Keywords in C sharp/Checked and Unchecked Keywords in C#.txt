Checked and Unchecked Keywords in C#
  Why do we need Checked and Unchecked Keywords in C#?
    According to MSDN, The Checked Keyword in C# is used to explicitly enable overflow checking for integral-type arithmetic operations and conversions.
    The Unchecked Keyword in C# is used to suppress overflow-checking for integral-type arithmetic operations and conversions.
    Here, overflow checking means when the value of any integral type exceeds its range, it does not raise any exception, instead it will give us unexpected 
    or garbage results. If this is not clear at the moment, then donâ€™t worry we will try to understand the above two points with examples. 

  Unchecked keyword in C#:
    Let us understand the need and use of unchecked keyword in C#. The unchecked keyword behaves almost the same way as the default behavior of the compiler.
