Goto Statement in C#
  The Goto Statement in C# is used to transfer the control to the labeled statement in the program. The label is a valid identifier and placed just before the statement 
  from where the control is transferred. That means the goto Statement provides an unconditional jump from the goto to a labeled statement in the same function.
  Goto is a keyword and by using this goto keyword we can pass the control anywhere in the program in the local scope. When we are working with the goto statement it required
  an identifier called a label. Any valid identifier followed by a colon is called a label. Whenever we are working with a goto statement it is called an unstructured control 
  flow statement because it breaks the rule of structure programming language.
 
  Syntax to use goto statement in C# Language:
