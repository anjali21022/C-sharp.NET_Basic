Difference Between Convert.ToString and ToString Method in c#
  Convert.ToString and ToString Method in C#
    Both these methods are used to convert a value to a string. The difference is Convert.ToString() method handles null whereas the ToString() doesn’t handle null in C#.
    In C# if you declare a string variable and if you don’t assign any value to that variable, then by default that variable takes a null value. In such a case, 
    if you use the ToString() method then your program will throw the Null Reference Exception. On the other hand, if you use the Convert.ToString() method then 
    your program will not throw an exception.
